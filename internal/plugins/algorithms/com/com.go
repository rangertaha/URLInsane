// Algo

// Algo is taking the target domain name and adding additional words
// to it typically separated by a hyphen. example.com may end up looking like
// support-example[.]com. Something like this might find its way into a phishing
// message targeting an organization. It gives the appearance of it being I.T. support.

// Combo-squatting is a form of typosquatting that involves creating domain names combining a legitimate brand or word with another keyword. Itâ€™s a social engineering technique that aims to mislead users into believing the domain is related to a trusted website or service.

// For example, if the legitimate domain is amazon.com, a combo-squatted domain might be something like amazon-login.com or amazon-secure.com. These additional words or phrases make the fake domain look authentic or security-focused, increasing the chances that users will click the link.

// This tactic is used to trick users into visiting the site, often for malicious purposes like phishing attacks, credential harvesting, or spreading malware. Combo-squatting is particularly effective because the domains appear more trustworthy than simple typographical errors, as the added words can look plausible and contextually relevant.
