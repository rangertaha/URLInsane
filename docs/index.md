# URLInsane

Generates domain typos and variations used to detect and perform typo squatting, 
URL hijacking, phishing, and corporate espionage.  Inpired by URLCrazy I wanted 
to create a better version that supported multiple languages and linguistic typos.
I also wanted it to be a binary with fast execution time.

## Introduction
Generate and test domain typos and variations to detect and perform typo squatting, URL hijacking, phishing, and corporate espionage.

The engine is designed to execute concurrent typo algorithms then additional 
concurrent functions for each domain variation. The additional functions can 
check DNS records and much more. Its also designed for extensibility, allowing 
developers to add functionality and support for additional languages. See 
[URLInsane](https://rangertaha.github.io/urlinsane/) for more details.



## Installation

To get the latest updates, create the binary executable with the **make** command or 
[download](https://github.com/cybersectech-org/urlinsane/releases/tag/0.3.0) one of the 
pre-built release binaries. 

Get the project
```bash
go get github.com/cybersectech-org/urlinsane
```

Go to the project folder and run the **make** command.
```bash
cd ~/go/src/github.com/cybersectech-org/urlinsane/
make
```

After building the binary you can execute it within the **builds** directory 
that was created by the **make** command. 
```bash
cd builds/
./urlinsane -h
```




## Usage
Generate variations for `google.com` using the character omission **(CO)** algorithm.
```
urlinsane typo google.com -t co

## Algorithms

The modular architecture for code extensibility allows developers to add new typosquatting
algorithms with ease. Currently, we have implements 19 
typosquatting algorithms. 

1. **Missing Dot(MD)** is created by omitting a dot from the domain.
2. **Missing Dashes(MDS)** is created by omitting a dash from the domain.
3. **Strip Dashes(SD)** is created by stripping all dashes from the domain
4. **Character Omission(CO)** Omitting a character from the domain
5. **Character Swap(CS)** swaps two consecutive characters in a domain
6. **Adjacent Character Substitution(ACS)** replaces adjacent characters
7. **Adjacent Character Insertion(ACI)** inserts adjacent character
8. **Homoglyphs(HG)** replaces characters with characters that look similar
9. **Singular Pluralise(SP)** creates a singular domain plural and vice versa
10. **Character Repeat(CR)** repeats a character of the domain name twice
11. **Double Character Replacement(DCR)** repeats a character twice
12. **Common Misspellings(CM)** are created from common misspellings
13. **Homophones(HP)** Typos are created from sets of words that sound the same
14. **Vowel Swapping(VS)** is created by swaps vowels
15. **Bitsquatting(BF)** relies on random bit-errors
16. **Wrong Top Level Domain(WTLD)**
17. **Wrong Second Level Domain(W2TLD)**
18. **Numeral Swap(NS)** numbers, words and vice versa
19. **Wrong Third Level Domain(W3TLD)**

## Extra Functions

- **IDNA**    Show international domain name (Default)
- **MX**      Checking for DNS's MX records
- **TXT**     Checking for DNS's TXT records
- **IP**      Checking for IP address
- **NS**      Checks DNS NS records
- **CNAME**   Checks DNS CNAME records
- **SIM**     Show domain similarity % using fuzzy hashing with ssdeep
- **301**	Show domains redirects
- **GEO**	Show domains redirects

## TODO 

* Complete tool comparison
* Extract keywords from domains. Keywords will be used for additional algorithms
* Estimate popularity of a domain variant via google search
* Lookup whois record
* Emoji domains
* Grabs HTTP and SMTP service banners
