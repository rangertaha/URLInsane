Urlinsane is used to aid in the detection of typosquatting, brandjacking, URL hijacking, fraud, phishing attacks, corporate espionage, supply chain attacks, and threat intelligence. It's a command-line tool designed for the detection of typo-squatting across domains, usernames, and software packages. It scans for potential typosquatted variants by applying advanced typo squatting algorithms, information gathering, and data analysis.  It identifies potentially harmful variations of a victim's domain name, arbitrary names, and software packages that cybercriminals might exploit. 



## Features
* Fast execution time
* Cuncurrency in generating typos and collection informaiton
* Distribute queries to multiple DNS Servers
* Single downloadable binary with no system depedencies
* Plugin architecture for extensability
* Multi-lingual language modeling

# Languages

In typosquatting, language plays a significant role in manipulating legitimate terms and names to create deceptive variations that appear familiar to the target audience. Attackers use linguistic techniques to construct these variations in ways that exploit the visual similarity or familiarity of certain languages and alphabets.

DNS TXT records (Text Records) are a type of DNS record used to store arbitrary text data associated with a domain. Originally intended for descriptive text, theyâ€™re now widely used for various purposes, including domain verification, email authentication, and configuration data. TXT records allow domain owners to associate key-value data with their domain, which can be retrieved by external systems for verification and configuration purposes.

DNS MX records (Mail Exchange records) are a type of DNS record used to route email for a domain to designated mail servers. They help direct emails sent to a domain (e.g., user@example.com) to the correct mail servers that handle receiving and processing the email.
